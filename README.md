# Metagenomics_Pathogen_Discovery

**Abstract**

**Background**: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children, particularly in South Africa, where they account for a significant proportion of pediatric deaths. Conventional diagnostic methods often delay treatment, necessitating innovative approaches for rapid pathogen detection. This study evaluates the efficacy of shotgun metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) combined with BenzonaseÂ® Nuclease treatment in identifying pathogens in pediatric patients presenting with respiratory symptoms.

**Results**:  Analysis of four nasopharyngeal aspirate samples revealed diverse microbial profiles. Benzonase treatment increased the detection of microbial reads without significantly depleting host DNA. Pathogen discovery identified several bacteria and viruses associated with respiratory illnesses, including notable findings such as H. influenzae in symptomatic patients.

**Conclusions**: mNGS represents a promising tool for comprehensive pathogen detection in pediatric RTIs. The results highlight the importance of refining host DNA depletion strategies to enhance diagnostic capabilities, paving the way for future research on microbial dynamics and their clinical implications in respiratory infections.
