# Metagenomics_Pathogen_Discovery

Github repository for "Metagenomics for Pathogen Discovery in Children with Respiratory Infections"

**Abstract**

**Background**: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children. Conventional diagnostic methods have limitations for pathogen detection, which may delay effective treatment, necessitating innovative approaches for rapid pathogen detection. This study evaluates the efficacy of shotgun metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) combined with BenzonaseÂ® Nuclease treatment in identifying pathogens in pediatric patients presenting with respiratory symptoms, in comparison to multiplex viral PCR. 

**Results**:  Analysis of four paired nasopharyngeal aspirates revealed diverse microbial profiles. Benzonase treatment increased the detection of microbial reads, even though the relative proportion of host DNA was similar. We identified several bacteria and viruses associated with respiratory illnesses, including the viral pathogens that were detected with targeted viral PCR panels. 

**Conclusions**: mNGS represents a promising tool for comprehensive pathogen detection in pediatric RTIs. The results highlight the importance of refining host DNA depletion strategies to enhance diagnostic capacity, paving the way for future clinical implications in respiratory infections.
