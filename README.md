# Metagenomics_Pathogen_Discovery

**Abstract**

**Background**: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children, with tuberculosis (TB) contributing significantly. This study leverages metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to investigate pathogen detection in pediatric patients.

**Results**: Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from the Umoya cohort were analyzed, including four pediatric patients: two with confirmed TB, one with suspected TB, and one healthy control. Each patient provided two samples—one treated with Benzonase and one untreated. Benzonase-treated samples yielded an average of 35.3 million reads, while untreated samples averaged 24.8 million. Despite improved microbial reads in treated samples, host DNA accounted for 90% of total reads, indicating suboptimal depletion. Regarding pathogen discovery, Patient 1 showed potential bacterial-viral co-infection, Patient 2’s sequencing failed, and Patient 3 had additional bacterial species possibly related to TB. Patient 4, the healthy control, exhibited a normal microbiome, although Enterovirus D was detected in one sample. Pathogens identified included Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Cytomegalovirus, and Parvovirus B19, with distinct differences between symptomatic patients and the control.

**Conclusions**: This study emphasizes the complexity of microbial interactions in pediatric RTIs and highlights challenges in host DNA depletion. Optimizing protocols is crucial for improving microbial detection and diagnostic accuracy, particularly in children with TB, which could lead to better therapeutic strategies and outcomes.
